# HashMapActivity

There are two provided files, you should only have to make changes to Main.java, but you should familiarize yourself with the HikeRecord.java class. The instructions for the assignment are in `// TODO:` comments in the Main.java driver class. The assignment is designed to take ~30 minutes. If you find that it is taking significantly longer, please reach out to us at wfuchs@calpoly.edu and we can figure it out together. You've got this!
